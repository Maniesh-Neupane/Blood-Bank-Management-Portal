Blood Bank Management Portal
  A robust desktop application built with Core Java to streamline blood bank operations, donor tracking, and emergency blood group searching.


📖 Project Overview

The Blood Bank Management Portal replaces manual record-keeping with a centralized digital solution. Administrators can manage donor records, monitor real-time blood stock, and handle recipient requests more efficiently — especially during emergencies when quick access to matching donors and available units matters most.


🌟 Key Features

- Donor Registration: Securely add and store donor profiles and blood types.
- Live Stock Management: Monitor units for all groups (A+, B−, O+, etc.) in real time.
- Quick Search: Filter donors instantly by location or blood group for emergencies.
- Admin Security: Login system to protect sensitive medical and donor data.
- Modern GUI: Clean, user-friendly interface built using Java Swing and AWT.


📂 Repository Structure
